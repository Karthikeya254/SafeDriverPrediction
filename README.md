# SafeDriverPrediction
Insurance companies needs to predict the chances of a person applying for claims, based on the individual’s
profile. The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto
insurance claim in the next year. In this paper we present various data exploration, wrangling & modelling
techniques that would help us determine the probability of the individual to file for an auto insurance claim. The
paper demonstrates a detailed comparison within the different modelling approaches. Thus, ending up with the
best to determine the solution to our problem.
